# World's end Dreamer 

## A 2D visual exploration game 

**World's end Dreamer** is a proof of concept for a 2D point-and click exploration game. The game takes
inspiration from titles such as Omori, Yume Nikki, and Your Turn to Die. The game is made in Java using the swing repository.
This game was made for my Software Construction class at UBC. 
All assets in the game were made by me.
